            <h2>Things you don't know about him</h2>
        <ul class="facts">
          <li>
            Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary,
            Indiana. His father, Joseph Jackson, was a boxer, steelworker, and a
            guitarist but to provide for his family, he worked as a crane
            operator. His mother, Katherine Esther Scruse, was a devout
            Jehovah’s Witness, but also worked part-time at a departmental
            store. He had a big family with 3 sisters and 5 brothers.
          </li>

          <li>
            MJ’s father was violent with him and his brothers. He faced physical
            and emotional abuse during unceasing rehearsals. During an
            interview, he had revealed that his father used to beat him and his
            brothers with a strap and didn’t regret doing so.
          </li>
          <li>
            He gave his first public performance at the age of 5 singing Climb
            Every Mountain.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the late 60s and early 70s, the Jackson 5 recorded many songs,
            such as Big Boy, The Love You Save, I’ll Be There, Got to Be There,
            I Want You Back, and many more hits.
          </li>
          <li>
            His song “Billie Jean” has earned the tag of being the first song by
            a black artist to be aired on MTV.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1983, his album- Thriller proved to be a worldwide hit by selling
            around 65 million copies
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1983, with around 47 million viewers, Motown was a huge success
            where Jackson performed “Billie Jean” and showed his famous dance
            move called “The Moonwalk.”
          </li>
          <li>
            The word “shamone” became popular from MJ’s song, “Bad” released in
            1987. MJ used “shamone” instead of “come on” in the song. It is also
            considered as MJ’s tribute to soul singer Mavis Staples, who used
            the word, “shamone” in a live version of “I’ll Take You There” in
            1975.”
          </li>
          <li>
            After signing a $5 million deal with Pepsi-Cola, he got severely
            injured while filming a commercial for them. It caused burns to his
            face and scalp. When his injuries were getting addressed, he began
            experimenting with plastic surgery.
          </li>
          <li>In 1993, MJ was diagnosed with Vitiligo, which is a rare skin disease in which the pigment is lost from areas of the skin, causing whitish patches.</li>
